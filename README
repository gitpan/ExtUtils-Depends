NAME
    ExtUtils::Depends - Easily build XS extensions that depend on XS
    extensions

SYNOPSIS
            use ExtUtils::Depends;
            $package = new ExtUtils::Depends ('pkg::name', 'base::package')
            # set the flags and libraries to compile and link the module
            $package->set_inc("-I/opt/blahblah");
            $package->set_lib("-lmylib");
            # add a .c and an .xs file to compile
            $package->add_c('code.c');
            $package->add_xs('module-code.xs');
            # add the typemaps to use
            $package->add_typemaps("typemap");
            # save the info
            $package->save_config('Files.pm');

            WriteMakefile(
                    'NAME' => 'Mymodule',
                    $package->get_makefile_vars()
            );

DESCRIPTION
    This module tries to make it easy to build Perl extensions that use
    functions and typemaps provided by other perl extensions. This means
    that a perl extension is treated like a shared library that provides
    also a C and an XS interface besides the perl one. This works as long as
    the base extension is loaded with the RTLD_GLOBAL flag (usually done
    with a

            sub dl_load_flags {0x01}

    in the main .pm file) if you need to use functions defined in the
    module.
